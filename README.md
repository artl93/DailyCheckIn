## Project

What if we knew more about the onset of symptoms? What if we knew whether that tickle in your throat meant something before it became a problem? Minor cases are not directed to the hospital, so we're missing tons of data and assuming spread based on models rather than data. So, we're all at risk.

What if we were able to track everyone (or at least a staistically significant part of the population), including healthy people before they came down with COVID-19?  What if we could help people identify their own risk before we have testing kits available everywhere?

I believe there's a potential to help the CDC here understand more about the virus, the spread, and help communities identify risk, by asking people to do one simple thing: take a short survey every day.
